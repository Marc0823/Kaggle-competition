# ROGII Execution Log - 2026-06-29

This log records concrete execution against `goals/rogii_iterative_submission_optimization.md`.

## Current Batch

Batch question:

```text
Q20260629-03: What should the first executable batch test now that static replay is known risky?
```

Selected approach:

```text
Run a hidden-compatible baseline reproduction under joezzzzz plus prepare a structural GR/typewell candidate.
```

Reason:

- Static Sunny80/Sunny70 notebooks completed with blank public score and are treated as hidden-format risk.
- Henry TabICL/v10 hidden-compatible retry is still pending, so it should be monitored but should not block independent preparation.
- A joezzzzz-owned baseline reproduction is needed before future aggressive daily batches can safely run from the active account.

## Kaggle State Snapshot

  - Added the v1 rejection, v2 audit, and fifth-slot official submission record.

## Goal Protocol Refinement

Latest Kaggle status recheck on 2026-06-29 UTC:

```text
54174876 fleongg branch calibration: PENDING
54174151 active-account baseline reproduction: PENDING
54162612 Henry TabICL/v10 hidden-compatible retry: PENDING
```

Because the score-dependent questions are still pending, the next useful work is process and preflight work that does not depend on those public scores.

The goal plan was refined so every work block follows this control loop:

```text
specific question -> multiple feasible options -> Codex-selected option with reasoning -> execution -> review -> next questions
```

Added to `goals/rogii_iterative_submission_optimization.md`:

- required active question categories: score, model, validation, submission, and operations;
- option lanes: conservative, structural/high-upside, diagnostic, calibration, and block/defer;
- a `0-3` option scoring rule for upside, information value, independence, audit readiness, validation support, submission efficiency, overfit risk, and implementation cost;
- default batch shape for 4-5 informative daily submissions;
- required batch review order;
- outcome-to-question branches for improvements, ties, worsening, catastrophic failures, blank scores, pending scores, and audit failures;
- human escalation boundaries.

Records added:

- `experiments/question_backlog.csv`
  - Added `Q20260629-B11` as the active process-control question.
- `experiments/question_decision_log.csv`
  - Added `Q20260629-07` recording the selected goal-file protocol.
- `README.md`
  - Added the short project control loop and option-comparison rule.

## Reference Notebook Preflight

Latest official submission check:

```text
54174876 fleongg branch calibration: PENDING
54174151 active-account baseline reproduction: PENDING
54162612 Henry TabICL/v10 hidden-compatible retry: PENDING
```

Because the score-dependent questions are still pending, the active independent question is:

```text
Q20260629-08: Which reference notebook should be prepared while official scores are still pending?
```

Options reviewed:

| option | decision | reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Degnonguidi 7.159 no-submit preflight | selected | source audit PASS; high-upside reference; tests dependencies/output without spending official submission |
| Baidalin 7.201 no-submit preflight | hold/fix required | source audit FAIL on hardcoded visible well and unsafe train/test `TVT_input` row copy |
| wait for scores only | rejected | does not prepare the next candidate queue |

Source audit artifacts were written locally under ignored `artifacts/reference_audits/`.

Degnonguidi active-account preflight:

```text
working copy: working/kaggle_kernel_degnonguidi_7159_preflight_joezzzzz
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 1
status: RUNNING
official submission: none
```

Records updated:

- `reports/reference_notebook_preflight_2026-06-29.md`
  - Added the reference-notebook preflight decision, source audit results, metadata notes, and branch rules.
- `experiments/kernel_run_ledger.csv`
  - Added kernel run records for baseline, fleongg branch, and Degnonguidi preflight.
- `experiments/question_backlog.csv`
  - Moved Q20260629-B07 to `kernel_running`.
  - Initially moved Q20260629-B08 to `hold_fix_required`; later patched Baidalin and moved it to `kernel_running`.
- `experiments/question_decision_log.csv`
  - Added Q20260629-08 for this preflight decision.

### Baidalin Source Patch

```

Source audit after patch:

```text
status: PASS
failures: 0
warnings: 0
```

Patch details:

- removed hardcoded visible demo well selection;
- replaced fixed-width `id` slicing with `rsplit('_', 1)`;
- replaced unsafe train/test `TVT_input` row copy with MD-aligned interpolation;
- aligned physical-model predictions onto test rows by MD and falls back to selector output if unavailable.

Pushed active-account no-submit preflight:

## Deep Pre-Submit Audit

Latest status recheck:

```text
official submissions: 54174876, 54174151, 54162612 still PENDING
Degnonguidi preflight kernel: RUNNING
```

Because no external result was ready, the next independent validation question was:

```text
Q20260629-09: What validation work should proceed while official scores and Degnonguidi preflight are pending?
```

Selected option:

```text
Implement deep pre-submit audit.
```

Reason:

- The next completed kernel output needs stronger checks before any official submission.
- Deep audit is reusable for every candidate output.
- It directly supports Q20260629-B05: detect shape and hidden-format risks before spending slots.

Updated `scripts/pre_submit_audit.py` with optional:

- `--data-dir` for sample/test-aware checks;
- `--reference LABEL=PATH` for distance to known outputs;
- anchor continuity metrics;
- slope/jump/curvature metrics;
- typewell TVT range metrics;
- JSON output for per-candidate audit artifacts.

Validation commands passed:

```text
python3 -m py_compile scripts/pre_submit_audit.py

```

Key validation results:

| candidate | status | risk_status | reference | rmse | p95 abs diff | anchor p90 | jump rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| baseline vs baseline | PASS | PASS | current_best | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.036088 | 0.000071 |

| fleongg vs baseline | PASS | PASS | current_best | 3.921052 | 9.255842 | 0.124812 | 0.000000 |

Records updated:

- `experiments/question_backlog.csv`
  - Moved Q20260629-B05 to `implemented_needs_field_use`.
- `experiments/question_decision_log.csv`
  - Added Q20260629-09.
- `README.md`
  - Added the deep pre-submit audit command.
- `goals/rogii_iterative_submission_optimization.md`
  - Moved deep pre-submit audit extension into Done and added next reference-bundle work.

## Degnonguidi Preflight V1 Failure And V2 Retry

Final status check after the deep-audit commit showed:

```text
joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex version 1: ERROR
official submissions 54174876, 54174151, 54162612: still PENDING
```

Downloaded v1 output/log:

```text
artifacts/degnonguidi_7159_preflight_joezzzzz_v1/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex.log
```

Log diagnosis:

```text
PapermillExecutionError at In [10]
KeyError at X_test_A = test_df_A[features_A]
missing train artifact feature columns in test_df_A:
beam_vcons_d, beam_vloose_d, beam_stiff_d, and td*/tda*/tdbc*/tdsc*/tdpf* columns
```

Decision:

- Do not submit anything.
- Do not switch to Baidalin, because Baidalin source audit is still failed.
- Patch the ignored Degnonguidi working notebook with a conservative feature-schema guard and rerun a no-submit preflight.

Patch logic:

```text
Before selecting X_test_A, find Pipeline A features missing from test_df_A.
For each missing feature, fill test_df_A[col] with the median from train_df_A[col].
If the train median is non-finite, use 0.0.
```

Validation:

```text
notebook source audit after patch: PASS
```

Pushed retry:

```text
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 2
status: ERROR
official submission: none
```

Version 2 log diagnosis:

```text
Feature-schema patch worked:
Pipeline A features built in 329s | train rows=3783989 test rows=14151 features=195

Then artifact trainer loading failed:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'koolbox'
```

Decision:

- Do not submit anything.
- Keep Baidalin held because its source audit remains failed.
- Add a visible `koolbox.Trainer` compatibility stub that maps to the notebook's `CVTrainer` replacement, so joblib can unpickle artifact trainers without internet or private source access.

Source audit after v3 patch:

```text
status: PASS
failures: 0
warnings: 0
```

Pushed second retry:

```text
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 3
status: RUNNING
official submission: none
```

## Standard Reference Registry

Added a standard reference bundle for deep pre-submit audits:

```text
experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv
```

Updated `scripts/pre_submit_audit.py` with:

```text
--reference-registry experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv
```

Validation command:

```text
python3 scripts/pre_submit_audit.py artifacts/lucifer_baseline_repro_joezzzzz_v1/submission.csv --data-dir data/sample --reference-registry experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv --json-out artifacts/lucifer_baseline_repro_joezzzzz_v1/registry_pre_submit_audit.json
```

Key validation results:

| reference | status | rmse | p95 abs diff |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| current_best_7p235 | PASS | 0.000000 | 0.000000 |
| fleongg_branch_pending | PASS | 3.921052 | 9.255842 |
| unavailable historical artifact paths | SKIP |  |  |

The baseline registry audit returned `status=PASS` and `risk_status=WARN` only because several optional historical artifact files are not present in the lean local workspace.

Records updated:

- `experiments/kernel_run_ledger.csv`
  - Marked v2 as `ERROR`.
  - Added v3 as `RUNNING`.
- `experiments/question_backlog.csv`
  - Updated Q20260629-B05 and Q20260629-B07.
- `experiments/question_decision_log.csv`
  - Added Q20260629-11 and Q20260629-12.
- `reports/reference_notebook_preflight_2026-06-29.md`
  - Added v2 failure details and v3 patch branch rules.

## Submission Ledger Sync Utility

Added:

```text
scripts/update_submission_ledger.py
```

Purpose:

- read Kaggle official submission rows through `kaggle competitions submissions --csv`;
- normalize statuses such as `SubmissionStatus.PENDING` to `pending`;
- update known `submission_id` rows with status, public score, and file name;
- optionally append missing Kaggle rows as `needs_review`.

Validation:

```text
python3 -m py_compile scripts/update_submission_ledger.py
python3 scripts/update_submission_ledger.py --kaggle-bin /home/ubuntu/workstation/JoeProject/kaggle-api-workbench/.venv/bin/kaggle --page-size 12 --dry-run
python3 scripts/update_submission_ledger.py --kaggle-bin /home/ubuntu/workstation/JoeProject/kaggle-api-workbench/.venv/bin/kaggle --page-size 12 --append-missing
```

Dry-run result:

```text
kaggle_rows: 12
updated: []
missing_not_appended: 54099186
unchanged_known: 11
```

Non-dry result:

```text
appended: 54099186
```

The appended row is the older `Aevion LB52 fixed test-only v4 nonzero` official submission, now tracked as `needs_review`, `complete`, blank public score.

Also normalized `experiments/question_decision_log.csv` as standard machine-readable CSV. Several older rows contained unquoted commas in prose fields; after normalization all experiment CSV files parse cleanly with `csv.DictReader`.

## Degnonguidi v3 Failure And v4 Retry

Version 3 status:

```text
status: ERROR
official submission: none
```

Downloaded log:

```text
artifacts/degnonguidi_7159_preflight_joezzzzz_v3/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex.log
```

Failure:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'koolbox.trainer'; 'koolbox' is not a package
```

Interpretation:

- The v3 `koolbox.Trainer` stub was too shallow.
- Artifact pickles reference the submodule path `koolbox.trainer`.
- This is still a no-submit runtime compatibility issue, not an official submission failure.

Decision:

- Patch the ignored working notebook to register both `koolbox` and `koolbox.trainer`.
- Keep source audit as the gate before pushing.

Validation:

```text
notebook source audit after v4 patch: PASS
```

Pushed retry:

```text
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 4
status: ERROR
official submission: none
```

Version 4 failure:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'koolbox.trainer.trainer'; 'koolbox.trainer' is not a package
```

Decision:

- Keep this as a no-submit dependency preflight.
- Register the observed nested pickle path `koolbox.trainer.trainer`.
- If another nested module path or class-contract failure appears, decide between inference-core port and blocking Degnonguidi rather than blindly patching forever.

Source audit after v5 patch:

```text
status: PASS
failures: 0
warnings: 0
```

Pushed nested retry:

```text
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 5
status: ERROR
official submission: none
```

Version 5 failure:

```text
AttributeError: 'CVTrainer' object has no attribute 'models_'
```

Interpretation:

- Nested `koolbox` module compatibility worked.
- The first artifact trainer loaded and reported overall RMSE `10.7668`.
- Prediction failed because the loaded object uses a different model-list attribute contract than the visible `CVTrainer` replacement.

Source audit after v6 patch:

```text
status: PASS
failures: 0
warnings: 0
```

Pushed trainer-contract retry:

```text
kernel: joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex
version: 6
status: RUNNING
official submission: none
```

## Pseudo-Test CV Utility

Added:

```text
scripts/pseudo_test_cv.py
```

Purpose:

- hide suffixes of training wells where true `TVT` is known;
- run native-prefix and prefix-fraction stress splits;
- compare simple method families before any official submission;
- write method-level and split-level evidence to tracked experiment files.

Validation command:

```text
python3 scripts/pseudo_test_cv.py --data-dir data/sample --output-dir experiments --report reports/pseudo_test_cv_report.md
```

Generated:

```text
experiments/pseudo_test_cv_scores.csv
experiments/pseudo_test_cv_summary.csv
reports/pseudo_test_cv_report.md
```

Sample-train result:

| method | weighted RMSE | mean delta vs last_value | win rate vs last_value |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| plateau_recent_quantile | 14.564 | -0.408 | 0.133 |
| last_value | 14.764 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| gr_shift_plateau_quantile | 15.379 | 0.165 | 0.267 |
| plateau_gated_tail_linear | 16.641 | 2.189 | 0.000 |
| gr_shift_tail_linear | 50.038 | 24.165 | 0.267 |
| tail_linear_md | 51.699 | 24.151 | 0.267 |
| best_strat_linear | 100.783 | 81.963 | 0.000 |
| full_linear_md | 1175.200 | 852.490 | 0.000 |

Interpretation:

- The visible sample train wells have plateau-like hidden suffixes.
- `last_value` is a strong conservative pseudo-test baseline.
- `plateau_recent_quantile` is the first sparse local rule to beat `last_value`: it moves only when the recent 256-row prefix median differs from the last prefix value by at least 4 TVT.
- GR-shift on top of the plateau rule is still worse than the plateau rule alone, so raw GR-shift should not be promoted.
- This is evidence for candidate design, not an official submission decision; the rule still needs comparison against the active baseline output and/or fuller train data.

## Plateau Candidate Probe

Added:

```text
scripts/build_plateau_recent_quantile_candidate.py
```

Build command:

```text
python3 scripts/build_plateau_recent_quantile_candidate.py --baseline artifacts/lucifer_baseline_repro_joezzzzz_v1/submission.csv --data-dir data/sample --output-dir artifacts/plateau_recent_quantile_v1
```

Candidate behavior:

- starts from the audited active-account baseline output;
- computes the recent 256-row prefix median from `TVT_input`;
- changes a well only if the median differs from the last prefix value by at least 4 TVT;
- generated sample candidate changed only `00e12e8b`.

Candidate audit:

```text
changed_wells: 1
rmse_delta_vs_baseline: 4.722388
sha256: 5e50c352d80039836fd0a83732fab7b67772e73771a2708bc363bfb15883fb02
deep pre-submit status: PASS
risk_status: WARN only because optional historical reference artifacts are absent locally
```

Local surrogate:

```text
risk_grade: plausible_submit_candidate
estimated_public_band: unknown_possible_but_risky
decision report: SUBMIT_CANDIDATE after audit review
```

Decision:

- Do not submit immediately while active-account baseline `54174151` and fleongg `54174876` are still pending.
- Keep as a future information-slot candidate only after pending scores clarify the active anchor and if no higher-value completed reference output is available.

## Plateau Stability Sweep

Added:

```text
scripts/plateau_quantile_sweep.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/plateau_quantile_sweep.py --data-dir data/sample
```

Sweep result:

```text
parameter combos: 36
combos beating last_value weighted RMSE: 10
beat rate: 0.278
default combo rank: 1
best combo: window=256, quantile=0.50, min_move=4.0, blend=1.0
best weighted RMSE: 14.563557
last_value weighted RMSE: 14.764009
weighted delta: -0.200451
win_rate_vs_last_value: 0.133333
fallback_rate: 0.800000
```

Interpretation:

- The default plateau candidate is the best tested setting and beats `last_value` on weighted pseudo-test RMSE.
- The signal is sparse and not broadly dominant: only 10/36 nearby combinations beat `last_value`, and the winning setting improves only 2/15 split rows while falling back on most others.
- Keep `plateau_recent_quantile_v1` as an information-slot candidate, not a strong promotion candidate, until pending official scores or fuller validation justify spending a submission.

## Henry Result

Official submission `54162612` completed:

```text
candidate: Henry TabICL/v10 hidden-compatible retry
status: COMPLETE
public score: 13.453
```

Decision:

- Mark as `negative_calibration`.
- Do not promote the raw Henry/TabICL artifact stack into the ensemble pool.
- Use this score to calibrate artifact-stack risk: hidden-compatible execution alone is not enough; alignment/model logic must beat the current references.

Records updated:

- `experiments/submission_ledger.csv`
- `experiments/daily_submission_plan.csv`
- `experiments/question_backlog.csv`

## Kernel Ledger Sync

Added:

```text
scripts/sync_kernel_ledger.py
```

Dry-run command:

```text
python3 scripts/sync_kernel_ledger.py --kaggle-bin /home/ubuntu/workstation/JoeProject/kaggle-api-workbench/.venv/bin/kaggle
```

Dry-run result:

```text
checked:
  - joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex/v6: RUNNING -> RUNNING
  - joezzzzz/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex/v1: RUNNING -> RUNNING
updated: []
errors: []
```

Decision:

- Use this script at the beginning of each polling pass.
- Keep the default as dry-run; use `--apply` only after reviewing changed statuses.
- If a row reaches `COMPLETE`, the script can set `next_action` to `download_output_and_deep_audit`; if it reaches `ERROR`, `next_action` becomes `download_log_and_triage`.

## Kernel Output Audit Wrapper

Added:

```text
scripts/audit_kernel_output.py
```

Purpose:

- download a completed Kaggle kernel output folder, unless `--skip-download` is provided;
- locate exactly one `submission.csv`;
- run `scripts/pre_submit_audit.py` with `--data-dir` and `--reference-registry`;
- write an optional compact JSON summary for the kernel output folder.

Validation command:

```text
python3 scripts/audit_kernel_output.py --kernel joezzzzz/rogii-lucifer-baseline-repro-codex --output-dir artifacts/lucifer_baseline_repro_joezzzzz_v1 --skip-download --data-dir data/sample --reference-registry experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv --summary-out artifacts/lucifer_baseline_repro_joezzzzz_v1/kernel_output_audit_summary.json
```

Validation result:

```text
audit_status: PASS
risk_status: WARN only because optional historical reference artifacts are absent locally
rows: 14151
sha256: fdf4a8175b6ec6a70c9b78fd6916ac3c317e43f7e9c08bbca87cd02314801ca9
```

Decision:

- Use this wrapper when Degnonguidi v6 or Baidalin v1 becomes `COMPLETE`.
- Do not make an official submission from a kernel output unless this wrapper's audit result is `PASS` and any warnings are reviewed.

## Next Batch Readiness

Added:

```text
scripts/next_batch_readiness_report.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/next_batch_readiness_report.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/next_batch_readiness.csv
reports/next_batch_readiness_report.md
```

Current summary:

```text
pending official submissions: 2
running kernels: 1
ready-after-audit candidates without context blockers: 0
WAIT_OFFICIAL_SCORE: 4
HOLD_PENDING_CONTEXT: 9
HOLD_INFORMATION_SLOT: 1
HOLD_LOW_UPSIDE: 2
HOLD_DUPLICATE: 6
```

Interpretation:

- The learned-signal/fleongg branch is already represented by pending official submission `54174876`; do not resubmit equivalent files.
- The Baidalin preflight output added one SP45 projection candidate and five SP45+Fleongg blend candidates; they are locally plausible but held for pending context.
- Projection branches and other plausible local candidates should wait for pending scores or the remaining running reference kernel.
- `plateau_recent_quantile_v1` remains a sparse information-slot candidate, not a current submission.
- The next official batch should not spend another slot until pending scores or Degnonguidi v6 resolves.

## Baidalin Completion And Output Audit

Polling command:

```text
python3 scripts/sync_kernel_ledger.py --kaggle-bin /home/ubuntu/workstation/JoeProject/kaggle-api-workbench/.venv/bin/kaggle --apply
```

Result:

```text
joezzzzz/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex/v1: RUNNING -> COMPLETE
joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex/v6: still RUNNING
```

Output audit commands:

```text
python3 scripts/audit_kernel_output.py --kernel joezzzzz/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex --output-dir artifacts/kernel_outputs/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex_v1 --kaggle-bin /home/ubuntu/workstation/JoeProject/kaggle-api-workbench/.venv/bin/kaggle --force-download --summary-out artifacts/kernel_outputs/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex_v1/audit_summary.json
python3 scripts/audit_kernel_output.py --kernel joezzzzz/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex --output-dir artifacts/kernel_outputs/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex_v1 --skip-download --data-dir data/sample --reference-registry experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv --submission-name sp45_projection_submission.csv --audit-name sp45_projection_deep_pre_submit_audit.json --summary-out artifacts/kernel_outputs/rogii-baidalin-7-201-preflight-codex_v1/sp45_projection_audit_summary.json
```

Audit result:

```text
default submission.csv: PASS, risk WARN only for missing optional local reference files
sp45_projection_submission.csv: PASS, risk WARN only for missing optional local reference files
```

Decision:

- Do not submit the default Baidalin `submission.csv`; it is a near-duplicate low-upside anchor copy.
- Track `sp45_projection_submission.csv` and the five `submission_sp45_fleongg_w*.csv` blends as real next-batch candidates.
- Hold all Baidalin-derived candidates until `54174151`, `54174876`, or Degnonguidi v6 gives enough context.

## Candidate Audit Coverage

Polling result before this work:

```text
official submissions 54174151 and 54174876: unchanged / still pending
joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex/v6: still RUNNING
```

Added:

```text
scripts/candidate_audit_summary.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/candidate_audit_summary.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/candidate_audit_summary.csv
reports/candidate_audit_summary_report.md
```

Audit coverage result:

```text
candidates tracked: 22
MISSING_AUDIT: 0
AUDITED_WAIT_CONTEXT: 13
HOLD_DUPLICATE: 6
HOLD_LOW_UPSIDE: 2
HOLD_INFORMATION_SLOT: 1
```

Decision:

- The current readiness candidate set now has per-file audit evidence.
- All five Baidalin SP45+Fleongg blend files passed deep pre-submit audit with `WARN` only for missing optional local reference artifacts.
- No official submission was made; candidates remain held until pending public scores or Degnonguidi v6 resolve.

## Conditional Next Submission Batch

Polling result before this work:

```text
official submissions 54174151 and 54174876: unchanged / still pending
joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex/v6: still RUNNING
```

Added:

```text
scripts/next_submission_batch_plan.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/next_submission_batch_plan.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/next_submission_batch_plan.csv
reports/next_submission_batch_plan.md
```

Current planned slots:

```text
1: Baidalin SP45 projection structural candidate
2: Baidalin SP45+Fleongg blend w0.50
3: Baidalin SP45+Fleongg blend w0.55
4: Baidalin SP45+Fleongg blend w0.60
5: plateau_recent_quantile_v1 flexible information slot
```

Decision:

- All planned slots are currently `WAIT_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT` and `do_not_submit_yet`.
- Release depends on pending official scores and/or explicit Degnonguidi v6 deferral/completion.
- If Degnonguidi v6 completes and audits cleanly, insert its best distinct output ahead of lower-priority blend or plateau slots.

## Poll And Refresh Wrapper

Added:

```text
scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/poll_refresh_summary.csv
reports/poll_refresh_report.md
```

Current safe polling summary:

```text
kernel_updates_detected: 0
submission_updates_detected: 0
pending_official_submissions: 2
running_kernels: 1
batch_status: WAIT_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT
planned_slots: 5
current_action_counts: do_not_submit_yet=5
```

Decision:

- Use this wrapper as the default polling pass.
- The wrapper does not submit to Kaggle and uses dry-run submission syncing by default.
- If dry-run detects updates, review them and rerun with explicit apply flags before spending official slots.

## Submission Release Gate

Added:

```text
scripts/submission_release_gate.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/submission_release_gate.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/submission_release_gate.csv
reports/submission_release_gate_report.md
```

Current gate result:

```text
overall status: BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT
release_gate_counts: BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT=5
```

Decision:

- The release gate is now part of `scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py`.
- All five currently planned slots are explicitly blocked because pending official scores and Degnonguidi v6 still affect interpretation.
- `scripts/next_submission_batch_plan.py` now accepts future `READY` and `READY_REVIEW_WARNINGS` audit-summary states, so candidates will not disappear from the plan after blockers clear.

## Planning State Validation

Added:

```text
scripts/validate_planning_state.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/validate_planning_state.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/planning_state_validation.csv
reports/planning_state_validation_report.md
```

Current validation result:

```text
overall status: PASS
error failures: 0
checks passed: 17
```

Decision:

- The validation step is now part of `scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py`.
- It checks planned-slot count, release rows, audit/readiness coverage, duplicate hashes, missing audits, and blocker behavior.
- Official submissions should not be made unless this validation has zero error failures.

## Result Branch Matrix

Added:

```text
scripts/result_branch_matrix.py
```

Run command:

```text
python3 scripts/result_branch_matrix.py
```

Outputs:

```text
experiments/result_branch_matrix.csv
reports/result_branch_matrix.md
```

Current branch rules:

```text
B01_baseline_anchor_valid -> promote baseline anchor, allow SP45 projection review
B02_baseline_anchor_failed -> block dependent submissions and repair baseline path
B03_fleongg_competitive -> prioritize SP45+Fleongg blend sweep
B04_fleongg_weak -> downweight blends and prefer pure SP45/plateau
B05_degnonguidi_complete_clean -> insert distinct Degnonguidi output ahead of lower-priority slots
B06_degnonguidi_error_or_defer -> allow Baidalin-derived slots if scores resolve and gate passes
B07_no_external_change -> continue preparation without official submission
```

Decision:

- The branch matrix is now part of `scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py`.
- It makes the pending-result response explicit before scores arrive, reducing the chance of ad hoc public-LB chasing.
- Current state still follows `B07_no_external_change`.

## Candidate Artifact Convention

Added:

```text
scripts/init_candidate_artifact.py
experiments/candidate_artifact_convention.csv
reports/candidate_artifact_convention.md
```

Decision:

- Future promoted candidate outputs should use a standard ignored `artifacts/<candidate_id>/` folder.
- The local folder should contain the exact selected `submission.csv`, `deep_pre_submit_audit.json`, `candidate_manifest.json`, and optional build notes/audits.
- Downloaded multi-output kernel folders can remain under `artifacts/kernel_outputs/`; when one file is promoted, create a manifest folder that points back to that selected source file.
- The convention keeps generated submissions out of Git while making every official candidate traceable through audit summary, release gate, planning validation, and submission ledger.

## Next Actions

1. Poll official submission `54174151`.
2. Poll official submission `54174876`.
3. Poll `joezzzzz/rogii-degnonguidi-7159-preflight-codex` version 6.
4. If Degnonguidi v6 completes, download output and run deep pre-submit/distance audit with `experiments/reference_submission_registry.csv` before any official submission decision.
5. If `54174151` reproduces the expected baseline region, close Q20260629-B01 and use the output as the active-account anchor.
6. Compare `54174876` vs `54174151` once both scores appear to decide whether standalone learned signal deserves future ensemble weight.
7. Re-run `scripts/poll_and_refresh_state.py` before spending official slots, then inspect `reports/submission_release_gate_report.md`, `reports/planning_state_validation_report.md`, and `reports/result_branch_matrix.md`.
8. Hold `plateau_recent_quantile_v1` until pending scores resolve or fuller train validation supports using it as a sparse information slot.
9. Use `scripts/init_candidate_artifact.py` before promoting any new locally generated output into the official-submission queue.
